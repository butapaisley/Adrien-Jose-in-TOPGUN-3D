General To Do:
-Add split-screen
-Add options for music in menu

Missiles:
-Add a lock on system with sounds
-Add sounds to when you destroy it

Enemy AI:
-Make them move. Perhaps in a V/W motion.
-Make them shoot bullets or missiles? Bullets seem like a bad idea.


Player:
-Make an after-burner animation
-Make chaff and flares(but no need to add a confusing heat signature 
thing, just make the missile explode/turn off collison for a lil bit)
